# Supabase Integration Concurrent Task List

This document breaks down the Supabase integration plan into small tasks that multiple AI coders can tackle concurrently. Each group contains up to four tasks.

## Group 1: Dependency Setup and Environment

1. Add `@supabase/supabase-js` to `package.json` dependencies.
2. Install packages with `npm install` (handled by environment setup).
3. Configure environment variables for Supabase credentials (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`).
4. Verify environment configuration with a simple Node.js script that instantiates a Supabase client.

## Group 2: Supabase Client Module

1. Create `src/server/supabaseClient.ts` exporting a configured Supabase client.
2. Write TypeScript types for Supabase configuration.
3. Add basic connection test to ensure the client can query the `pg_catalog` tables.
4. Document the module in `docs/supabase-client.md`.

## Group 3: Supabase Connector

1. Implement `SupabaseConnector` class with query and insert methods.
2. Handle errors and return typed results.
3. Create unit tests for the connector using Jest.
4. Update server initialization to register the connector.

## Group 4: Agent Integration

1. Extend data source selection logic to include Supabase.
2. Translate natural language queries into SQL targeting Supabase tables.
3. Stream query results back through AGâ€‘UI events.
4. Add logging for query performance metrics.

## Group 5: Frontend Enhancements

1. Add Supabase option to data source dropdown in the UI.
2. Build forms for selecting tables or schemas.
3. Display query progress and error messages.
4. Provide a demo page that visualizes Supabase data using generative charts.

## Group 6: Security and Testing

1. Set up Row Level Security policies in Supabase for demo tables.
2. Add environment variable checks to prevent missing credentials in production.
3. Write integration tests that hit a staging Supabase instance.
4. Review and sanitize all SQL inputs to avoid injection vulnerabilities.

## Group 7: Documentation and Deployment

1. Update README with Supabase setup instructions.
2. Add examples of queries and expected outputs.
3. Document how to run the integration tests.
4. Prepare deployment scripts or Dockerfiles that include Supabase credentials as environment variables.
